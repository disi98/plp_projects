# 1. Write a program that accepts user input to create a list of integers. Then, compute the sum of all the integers in the list.
# 2. Create a tuple containing the names of five of your favorite books. Then, use a for loop to print each book name on a separate line.
# 3. Write a program that uses a dictionary to store information about a person, such as their name, age, and favorite color. Ask the user for input and store the information in the dictionary. Then, print the dictionary to the console.
# 4. Write a program that accepts user input to create two sets of integers. Then, create a new set that contains only the elements that are common to both sets.
# 5. Create a program that stores a list of words. Then, use list comprehension to create a new list that contains only the words that have an odd number of characters.

# Create an empty list called my_list.
# Append the following elements to my_list: 10, 20, 30, 40.
# Insert the value 15 at the second position in the list.
# Extend my_list with another list: [50, 60, 70].
# Remove the last element from my_list.
# Sort my_list in ascending order.
# Find and print the index of the value 30 in my_list.
